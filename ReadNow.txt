Line 187, Third Person Controller: changed x and z velocities to * 1.5f

NOT SAVED TO REPO: Also messed with using triggers for the ground check instead of a raycast. Cleared up the jumping glitch, but the player would no longer
fall right away if they walked off a cliff. Instead they slowly drifted down until either they weren't moving (no input) or until they hit
an object.
